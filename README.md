# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is currently being built.

Things to do:
    - Change file paths to not be hardcoded
    - Turn on file formatting
    - Refactor to use classes etc
    - Maybe use numba for the big operations

The eventual aim is for this to be somewhat useable by someone who isn't me.
A level of quantum physics knowledge is probably always going to be necessary.
