# File explanations

#### File list (and explanations) as of 18/08/20

- phase_damping_graph
  - very simple plot of phase damping against photon loss probability
  - may be useful, I'll keep it cos why not
  - don't expect much to happen though tbh
- phase_damping_polarisation
  - not quite sure what this one does from a physics perspective, cos I can't remember how NFF works, but it has a load of useful functions for conversion between different representations of Kraus operators, so I'll definitely keep it just for that
  - makes a graph of Z polarisation against gamma, for specific values of $q_0$ and phase
    - seems like it will be very useful if I ever care about NFF specifically
- delta_gamma_grapher
  - plots delta against gamma, but IDK what those are
  - could easily be remade if I find out what it's for
